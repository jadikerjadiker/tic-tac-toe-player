PPWithNNTwoPlayerGame is an abstract class (with the occasional pre-implemented method)
...for any two player game where the game has a state
...and players can make moves (represented by numbers or strings).
If all of the methods are implemented, a PolicyPlayerWithNeuralNet can learn to play the game.
