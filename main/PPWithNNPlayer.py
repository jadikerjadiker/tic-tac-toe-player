'''
The goal of this class is to have a computer that uses reinforcement learning in
...order to understand best strategies to win the game, and uses
...a neural network to generalize those strategies
...so the policy player does not have to play as many games in order to do well.

The main difference between this player and a TwoPlayerPolicyPlayer
...is that this player will use a neural net to both make and update its decisions.
